= Computer Science (ðŸ™µ Related) Books written by Indian Authors

This list attempts to documents various books within the Computer Science domain written by authors that are primarily Indian (or at least of Indian Origin).

The main motive for such a list is to track the advancement of Computer Science Education/Literature in India.

[NOTE]
This list only documents the books written by authors who are in **top academic institutions and industry**. This is due to the original intention of the CBIA list mentioned below.


The original list was http://library.iiitd.edu.in/opac-tmpl/bootstrap/en/includes/cbia.html[CBIA by IIID] which attempted to do the same however is not available anymore. Thus this repo was created. The original list with 122 book (as of writing this document) is included here. Beyond that are my own additions.
